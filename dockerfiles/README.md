# Containers for Deployment and Development
These are your virtual environments and deployment environments.

Modern IDE's (VSCode and PyCharm for example) support containers-as-virtualenv, and
 development can now happen in the environment native to deployment. 
 
Use the kitchen.Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml file to link the interpreter.
