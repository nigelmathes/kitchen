# The Head Chef Cooks the Final Dish
I.e. the transform stage of your ETL process.

## The Head Chef
In `head_chef.py` is the `HeadChef` class, which does all the work required to take
 the ingredients from the `SousChef` (`sous_chef/sous_chef.py`) and transform them
  into the
  final dish, which
  will be served to the `Restaurant` by the `Server`, and added to the `Menu`.
